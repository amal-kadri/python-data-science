# python-data-science
a collection of ML code samples for various supervised and unsupervised learning techniques using , data visualization, and data frame manipulation. (SKL, numpy, pandas, matpolotlib, etc)

templated from James Scott's assignments in R: https://github.com/jgscott/ECO395M/tree/master/exercises

Tasks:
 - Create directories for various topics:
      - Cleaning
      - Visualization
      - Bootstrapping/sampling
      - KNN
      - Linear Models (Maybe diff-in-diff stuff?)
      - Logit/Probit Models
      - Lasso
      - CART
      - Random Forests
      - Gradient Boosted Forests
      - PCA/Clustering
      - Text Analysis
      - Association Rules/Networks
      - Neural Networks
      ***Each will have subdirectories for different types of analysis.
